 <h2>Blogpost 1: Microsoft's acquisition of Activision Blizzard</h2>
 <article1>
    The acquisition of Activision Blizzard by the industry leading tech giant Microsoft marks itself down as not only
    the biggest acquisition in the video game industry, but also within the tech world. Coming in at a $68.7 billion dollar
purchase, Microsoft and their Xbox Division now owns beloved Intellectual Property franchises from the renowned dev studio such 
as Call of Duty, Crash Bandicoot, Overwatch, World of Warcraft & Diablo.

 Fans of the video game industry have long criticized Microsoft and Xbox for their lack first-party games that are exclusive to 
their platform, unlike their competitors, Sony and Nintendo. Following their $7.5 billion dollar 
Bethesda Softworks acquistion back in 2021, which comes with franchises such as Elder Scrolls, Doom, Fallout, and the recent 
Starfield, Microsoft now hosts a variety of titles that hopefully, in the future, allows them adequately comepete with the remainder
of the big three in terms of exclusives.

 <h2> Blogpost 2: The sunset of Nintendo's 8th generation console</h2>
 <article2>Nintendo released their hyrbid console - the Nintendo Switch, in early 2017. Following the failure of their previous
    home console, the Wii U - selling only around 13 million copies in its 5 years on the market; there was skepticism about their new 
    release from shareholders and fans alike. Despite this, the system released alongside its major debut title - The Legend of Zelda:
    Breath of the Wild to mostly positive critical acclaim.

    To date, the Nintendo Switch has sold over 125 million copies, making it the 3rd best selling video game console of all time, 
    behind only Sony's Playstation 2 and Nintendo's own DS family of systems, at 1st and 2nd respectively. The system's ability to act
    as both a home console and a portable machine has found widespread appeal, and despite the system's lack of raw power compared to its
    competitors, showing especially in some later 3rd party ports, its positives outweigh the negatives. It's been 6 years of the 
    system's time on the market, and Nintendo's own recent games showcase - and lack of such thereof indicate that development focus 
    has shifted to their next generation console. With that, surely marking the end of a successful generation for the big N.
